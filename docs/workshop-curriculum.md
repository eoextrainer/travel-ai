  - Food restaurant options: 5 choices per destination
  - Tourist and cultural sites: 5 choices per destination
  - On-site transportation: taxi, uber, private chauffeur, public transportation (5 choices per destination)

## Part 1 (20 min): Introduction & Concepts

Plain-English overview. No coding required.

1. What is an AI agent?
   - A smart assistant that follows instructions (a “prompt”) to do tasks.
   - We will guide it step by step to behave like a travel agent.

2. What will our agent do?
   - Ask for a destination region (Europe, Asia, Africa, Americas).
   - Offer transportation choices from home (bus, train, airplane).
   - Suggest accommodations, food options, places to visit, and local transport.
   - Present 5 curated choices per category for each destination.

3. How do we control it?
   - With a clear, structured prompt.
   - Prompts are like recipes: steps, ingredients, and the expected outcome.

4. Tools we’ll use (no deep dive):
   - An AI assistant (like Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini).
   - A simple text document with our prompt.
   - Optional: A browser or chat app where we paste the prompt.

5. Outcome of the workshop:
   - You’ll have a ready-to-use prompt and a workflow to get a travel plan.

## Part 2 (30 min): Using AI Prompts to Design Travel Flows

Hands-on prompt design. No coding.

1. Start with a friendly greeting and simple goal.
   - Example: “Help me plan a trip to Europe with transportation, accommodation, food, sites to visit, and on-site transport options.”

2. Add structure and clarity for each step:
   - Destination selection: “Offer 4 regions and let me pick.”
   - Transportation from home: “Give me bus, train, and airplane options (5 each).”
   - Accommodation: “Provide 5 choices by price range and comfort.”
   - Food: “Suggest 5 restaurants per destination: local cuisine, budget, mid-range, upscale.”
   - Tourist/Cultural: “List 5 sites per destination with short descriptions.”
   - On-site transport: “Give 5 choices including taxi, Uber, private chauffeur, public transit.”

3. Make it interactive:
   - Ask the AI to show options step by step.
   - Confirm choices before moving to the next category.

4. Keep the language simple:
   - Use short sentences and bullets.
   - Be specific about numbers: “Give 5 choices.”

5. Practice:
   - Participants copy the base prompt and try it with an AI assistant.
   - They select a region and see the next choices.

Tips:

- If results look messy, ask the AI: “Please use bullets and keep it concise.”
- If unclear, ask: “Can you rephrase that in simpler words?”

## Part 3 (40 min): Interacting with the Travel AI Agent

Hands-on with guided steps.

1. Choose a destination region.
   - The AI lists Europe, Asia, Africa, Americas.
   - You pick one.

2. Transportation from home.
   - The AI shows 5 bus, 5 train, and 5 airplane options relevant to your chosen destination.
   - You pick one and the AI notes the choice.

3. Accommodation.
   - The AI offers 5 choices (budget → luxury). You pick one.

4. Food options.
   - 5 restaurants matching local cuisine, budget, and style. You pick one or more.

5. Tourist & cultural sites.
   - 5 places with short descriptions and tips. You pick what you like.

6. On-site transport.
   - 5 choices including taxi, Uber, private chauffeur, public transit. You pick one.

7. Review your plan.
   - The AI summarizes your selections and proposes a daily schedule.

Facilitator guidance:

- Encourage participants to ask the AI for alternatives.
- Suggest asking for price ranges and travel times.
- Remind them they can copy the plan into a document.

## Part 4 (20 min): Personalizing and Exporting Results

1. Personalize.
   - Ask the AI to adjust for budget, dates, or preferences.
   - Example: “Make this trip family-friendly with activities for kids.”

2. Export.
   - Ask the AI to provide the final plan in clean bullets.
   - Copy into Google Docs.
   - Optional: Ask for a day-by-day itinerary.

3. Safety & expectations.
   - Remind that options are suggestions; verify prices and availability.

## Part 5 (10 min): Next Steps & Resources

- Try different regions and compare plans.
- Ask the AI to include travel insurance or visa tips.
- Save your prompts for future trips.
- Use the portable document (docs/portable.md) to copy everything easily.
